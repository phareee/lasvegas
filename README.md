LasVegas Casino
     Our LasVegas Casino Game is the Texas Hold'em Poker ,also called the "Cadillac of Poker," is the game you are going to play over and over again. So how do you play Texas hold'em? In Texas hold'em players are trying to make the best five-card poker hand according to traditional poker rankings. Each player is dealt two cards face down (the "hole cards"), then over the course of subsequent rounds five more cards are eventually dealt face up in the middle of the table. These face up cards are called the "community cards" because each player uses them to make a five-card poker hand.

The five community cards are dealt in three stages:

Stage 1: The first three community cards are called the "flop."

Stage 2: Then just one card is dealt, called the "turn."

Stage 3: Finally one more card, the fifth and final community card, is dealt — the "river."

   If the betting causes all but one player to fold, the lone remaining player wins the pot without having to show any cards. For that reason, players don't always have to hold the best hand to win the pot. If two or more players make it all of the way to the showdown after the last community card is dealt and all betting is complete, then the only way to win the pot is to have the highest-ranking five-card poker hand.
   
   Before the game started, you have to post small and big blinds. These are forced bets that begin the wagering and ensure there will be "action" on every hand.

The Action : when the action in on you, you can:

Check: Decline to bet

Fold: Withdraw from the hand, if someone else has bet already

Bet: Place a wager on the table

Raise: Add more chips by matching your opponent's bet and putting in a greater amount.

Call: Match the bet of your opponents to stay in the hand and continue to play.

First Betting Round: Preflop

The first round of betting takes place right after each player has been dealt two hole cards. The first player has to act first with three options — to call, to raise, or fold. The play proceeds around the table with each player also having the same three options. If the player chooses to fold, he or she is no longer eligible to win the current hand. The maximum raise can be all of the chips a player has in his or her stack (an "all-in" bet). Once the last bet is called and the action is "closed," the preflop round is over and play moves on to the "flop."


Second Betting Round: The Flop

After the first preflop betting round has been completed, the first three community cards are dealt and a second betting round follows involving only the players who have not folded already.
In this betting round (and subsequent ones), action starts with the first active player. Along with the options to bet, call, fold, or raise, a player now has the option to "check" if no betting action has occurred beforehand. A check simply means to pass the action to the next player in the hand.
Again betting continues until the last bet or raise has been called (which closes the action). 


Third Betting Round: The Turn

The fourth community card is called the “Turn” and again a new round of betting starts. Similar to that on the previous street of play, players have the option to options to check, bet, call, fold, or raise.


Final Betting Round: The River

The last community card is called the “River”. This is followed by a last round of betting.The river is dealt face up following all betting action on the turn. Once this has been completed, another round of betting occurs, similar to what took play on the previous street of play. Once more the remaining players have the option to options to check, bet, call, fold, or raise.
After all betting action has been completed, the remaining players in the hand with hole cards now expose their holdings to determine a winner. The player with the best combination of five cards wins.

Remember, players construct their hands by choosing the five best cards from the seven available (their two hole cards and the five community cards).
For example, if the board is showing 9♣5♠K♦3♠A♥, a player with the two hole cards A♦9♠ would have two pair (aces and nines), and would lose to a player who has 9♦9♥ for three of a kind (three nines).
